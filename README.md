[Link of project on google colab] (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14rqWLlkB9kUM1NZF1lw9UJ0wokfIkeVW?usp=sharing#scrollTo=b3e38d05)

This repository contains a collection of Python functions and scripts for basic image processing and histogram analysis using OpenCV and Matplotlib. These tools are useful for displaying images, comparing image transformations, and analyzing image histograms.

**Features**
-Image Display and Comparison: Plot and compare two images side by side.
-Color Space Conversion: Convert images from BGR to RGB.
-Histogram Plotting: Plot histograms of grayscale and color images.
-Image Manipulation: Adjust image brightness and contrast, and perform histogram equalization.
